<span class="command">subsection</span> Introduction

<span class="command">text</span> <span class="verbatim">{*

The order generator registers itself at the derive-manager for the classes @{class ord},
@{class order}, and @{class linorder}.
To be more precise,
it automatically generates the two functions @{term &quot;op &le;&quot;} and @{term &quot;op &lt;&quot;} for some datatype 
\texttt{dtype} and
proves the following instantiations.

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{instantiation dtype :: (ord,\ldots,ord) ord}
\item \texttt{instantiation dtype :: (order,\ldots,order) order}
\item \texttt{instantiation dtype :: (linorder,\ldots,linorder) linorder}
\end{itemize}

All the non-recursive types that are used in the datatype must have similar instantiations.
For recursive type-dependencies this is automatically generated.

For example, for the \texttt{datatype tree = Leaf nat | Node &quot;tree list&quot;} we require that
@{type nat} is already in @{class linorder}, whereas for @{type list} nothing is required, since for the 
\texttt{tree}
datatype the @{type list} is only used recursively.

However, if we define \texttt{datatype tree = Leaf &quot;nat list&quot; | Node tree tree} then 
@{type list} must
provide the above instantiations.

Note that when calling the generator for @{class linorder}, it will automatically also derive the instantiations 
for @{class order}, which in turn invokes the generator for @{class ord}. 
A later invokation of @{class linorder}
after @{class order} or @{class ord} is not possible.

<span class="command">subsection</span> <span class="string">&quot;Implementation Notes&quot;</span>

<span class="command">text</span> <span class="verbatim">{*
The generator uses the recursors from the datatype package to define a lexicographic order.
E.g., for a declaration 
\texttt{datatype &#39;a tree = Empty | Node &quot;&#39;a tree&quot; &#39;a &quot;&#39;a tree&quot;}
this will semantically result in
\begin{verbatim}
(Empty &lt; Node _ _ _) = True
(Node l1 l2 l3 &lt; Node r1 r2 r3) = 
  (l1 &lt; r1 || l1 = r1 &amp;&amp; (l2 &lt; r2 || l2 = r2 &amp;&amp; l3 &lt; r3))
(_ &lt; _) = False
(l &lt;= r) = (l &lt; r || l = r)
\end{verbatim}

The desired properties (like @{term &quot;x &lt; y ==&gt; y &lt; z ==&gt; x &lt; z&quot;}) 
of the orders are all proven using induction (with the induction theorem from the datatype on @{term x}),
and afterwards there is a case distinction on the remaining variables, i.e., here @{term y} and @{term z}.
If the constructors of @{term x}, @{term y}, and @{term z} are different always some basic tactic is invoked. 
In the other case (identical constructors) for each property a dedicated tactic was designed.

<span class="command">subsection</span> <span class="string">&quot;Features and Limitations&quot;</span>

<span class="command">text</span> <span class="verbatim">{*
The order generator has been developed mainly for datatypes without explicit mutual recursion. 
For mutual recursive datatypes---like
\texttt{datatype a = C b and b = D a a}---only
for the first mentioned datatype---here \texttt{a}---the instantiations of the order-classes are
derived.

Indirect recursion like in \texttt{datatype tree = Leaf nat | Node &quot;tree list&quot;} should work 
without problems.
