  Derivatives of WS1S Formulas
  
by Dmitriy Traytel


There are few small deviations from the description in the paper:

* the de Bruijn namespaces for first-order and second-order variables are disjoint
* sets are represented by plain unsorted lists
* a special formula "Eps f" is used to add the empty model/word to the language of the formula f
